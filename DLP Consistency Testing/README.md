Sequential Erosion Tissue Imaging (SETI) Microscope Project - Luxometer Testing 

This contains all the code and protocols needed to perform testing on the continuous intensity of a digital light projector's excitation at the sample plane. 


2018-07-04 DLP Consistency Testing Protocol.doc is the protocol used for examining the light intensity output by the digital light projector over time. 

DLP_Consistency.ocv is the Ocean View script used to gather data.

DLP_Consistency_Evaluation.m is the Matlab script which runs a basic evaluation and visualization of the light intensity being output by the digital light projector
