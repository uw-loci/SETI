Sequential Erosion Tissue Imaging (SETI) Microscope Project - Modeling

This folder contains some modeling of the SETI system

GaussianBeam2D_SETI.m is a script which examines the PSF and MTF of a simulated widefield setup and a simulated SETI setup. It also examines three post-processing correction methods. 

SETI_Model.m is a script which simulates an object generates a PSF then simulates the SETI forward problem and tests various reconstruction methods.

SIM_Simulation.m is a script which simulates the confocal effect created by an aperture and by structured illumination.
