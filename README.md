Sequential Erosion Tissue Imaging (SETI) Microscope Project

This is an on-going project which aims to develop a low-cost imaging system that combines physical and optical sectioning for imaging embedded samples. 


Embedding Protocol contains the protocols used for embedding a sample to be imaged with the SETI microscope.

Steering Code contains all the scripts and protocols needed for running the system hardware.

Processing Code contains all the scripts in a GUI fashion needed to perform post-processing on acquired images. 

Luxometer Testing contains all the code and protocols needed to perform testing on the continuous intensity of a digital light projector's excitation at the sample plane. 

Example Data Set contains a full data set acquired using the scripts in the Steering Code which has been processed using the scripts in the Processing Code from a bead sample embedded using the protocols in the Embedding Protocol Folder.



All the old files have been moved to the Old Code folder and will have their functionality merged with the other folders.
