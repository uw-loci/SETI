As a direct output from the steering code you will have one top directory with multiple sub-directories.


The top directory should end in:
_[number of images in the x-dimension]x_[number of images in the y-dimension]y_[number of images in the z-dimension]z_[depth of cutting between z-slices][cut scale (um,mm,cm)]_cuts
e.g. 2018-10-16-Tiled_Beads_20x_1ms_3x_3y_3z_10um_cuts   where 2018-10-16-Tiled_Beads_20x_1ms is the data set name 


The sub-directories come in two formats:
"Bright Field" or "BF" for the bright field matched locations if present in the run
and
[pattern pixel width used]ppx [number of sub-images]si [percent aperture used]ap [pattern used]

A typical set of sub-directories would look like:
18ppx 3si 0ap perfect bar
27ppx 3si 10ap perfect bar 
Bright Field
